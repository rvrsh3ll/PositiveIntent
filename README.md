# PositiveIntent
> [!WARNING]  
> Beta release. Please create an issue with as much detail as possible if you run into any bugs.
## Features

-  ETW disabled via process fork with environment variable `COMPlus_ETWEnabled` set to zero. No memory patching.
-  Unique AMSI patch that targets a writable pointer to `AmsiScanBuffer` in the .data section of `clr.dll`. This means that `amsi.dll` is never touched and no memory page permissions are changed anywhere.
-  PE headers of your assembly (after it's been decrypted and loaded) are stomped to hide it from memory page scanners looking for implanted PE signatures.
-  Hostname keying. 
-  Python pre-build script obfuscates all (most) methods, variables, strings, delegates, classes, and namespaces before building the loader (the code is disgusting don't read it please).
-  Your .NET assembly of choice (Rubeus, Seeker, etc.) is embedded in the loader as a resource file and RC4 encrypted.
-  No suspicious usage of crypto libraries - RC4 encryption/decryption is performed using a "raw" implementation of the RC4 algorithm (thanks ChatGPT).
-  No P/Invoke usage. D/Invoke only with API hashing.
- Copyright free English books are embedded as resource files in the loader to keep Shannon entropy between 4.50-5.50.
- Python post-build script signs the loader with a self-signed certificate using values cloned from a domain of your choice.
- Built with .NET Framework 4.8 and C# 7.3 for compatibility with various Windows versions.

## Installation (Kali/Debian-Based)

```
sudo apt update && apt install -y osslsigncode dirmngr ca-certificates gnupg

sudo apt update && apt install -y mono-complete
cd PositiveIntent
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- Add option to key on AD domain
- Add support for 32 bit processes
- Programatically generate and randomize `assemblyinfo.cs`
- Port all Python pre/post-build scripts to .NET & cross-compile for Linux
- Improve error handling
- ???
