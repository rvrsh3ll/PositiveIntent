## Features

- Sandbox Evasion
  -  Hostname keying
  -  Delayed execution (not susceptible to time acceleration)
- Shannon Entropy Normalization
  - Copyright free English books are embedded as resource files in the loader to keep entropy between 4.50-5.50
- ETW and AMSI Bypasses
  - ETW disabled via process fork with environment variable `COMPlus_ETWEnabled` set to zero
  - AmsiScanBuffer patched in-memory (via D/Invoke)
- Static Signature & Memory Scanning Evasion
  - Python pre-build script obfuscates all (most) methods, variables, and strings before building the loader
  - Your .NET assembly of choice (Rubeus, Seatbelt, etc.) is embedded in the loader as a resource file and RC4 encrypted
  - Certain variables, such as the byte array containing the opcodes used for patching AmsiScanBuffer, are also RC4 encrypted
  - No suspicious usage of crypto libraries - RC4 encryption/decryption is performed using a "raw" implementation of the RC4 algorithm (thanks ChatGPT)
- Miscellaneous AV/EDR Evasion Features
  - Python post-build script signs the loader with a self-signed certificate using values cloned from a domain of your choice
  - No P/Invoke - full implementation of D/Invoke with API hashing
- Compatibility
  - Built with .NET Framework 4.8 and C# 7.3 to ensure maximum compatibility with various Windows versions

## Roadmap

- Add option to key on username
- Add some sort of DNS blackhole sandbox check
- Add obfuscation of class names to `obfuscate.py`
- Add obfuscation of namespace names `obfuscate.py`
- Programatically generate and randomize `assemblyinfo.cs`
- Port all Python pre/post-build scripts to .NET & cross-compile for Linux
- Improve error handling
- ???
