# PositiveIntent
> [!WARNING]  
> Beta release. Please create an issue with as much detail as possible if you run into any bugs.
## Features

-  ETW disabled via process fork with environment variable `COMPlus_ETWEnabled` set to zero. No memory patching.
-  Unique AMSI patch that targets a writable pointer to `AmsiScanBuffer` in the .data section of `clr.dll`. This means that `amsi.dll` is never touched and no memory page permissions are changed anywhere.
-  PE headers of your assembly (after it's been decrypted and loaded) are stomped to hide it from memory page scanners looking for implanted PE signatures.
-  Hostname keying. 
-  Optional flag to redirect output to an encrypted file. Useful to avoid outputting signatured text to console (e.g. tool logos).
-  Optional flag to hardcode arguments to be passed to your assembly. Useful to avoid passing signatured arguments on the command line.
-  Python pre-build script obfuscates all (most) methods, variables, strings, delegates, classes, and namespaces before building the loader (the code is disgusting don't read it please).
-  Your .NET assembly of choice (Rubeus, Seeker, etc.) is embedded in the loader as a resource file and RC4 encrypted.
-  No suspicious usage of crypto libraries - RC4 encryption/decryption is performed using a "raw" implementation of the RC4 algorithm (thanks ChatGPT).
-  No P/Invoke usage. D/Invoke only with API hashing.
- Copyright free English books are embedded as resource files in the loader to keep Shannon entropy between 4.50-5.50.
- Python post-build script signs the loader with a self-signed certificate using values cloned from a domain of your choice.
- Built with .NET Framework 4.8 and C# 7.3 for compatibility with various Windows versions.

## Installation (Kali/Debian-Based)

```
sudo apt update && apt install -y osslsigncode dirmngr ca-certificates gnupg
sudo echo "deb [trusted=yes] https://download.mono-project.com/repo/debian stable-buster main" | tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mono-official-stable.list
sudo apt update && apt install -y mono-complete
cd PositiveIntent
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

```
python build.py --file /tmp/Rubeus.exe --hostname TEST --domain www.zoom.com

[+] Obfuscated loader source files
[+] Keyed on hostname TEST
[+] Encrypted and embedded /tmp/Rubeus.exe as a resource file
[+] Randomized loader filename
[+] Embedded 1 books as resource files
[+] Entropy of loader: 5.35
[+] Digitally signed loader with certificate cloned from www.zoom.com
[+] Loader compiled to /tmp/PositiveIntent/temp/pwCXupfi.exe
```

## Detection Status
> [!NOTE]  
> Detection status is evaluated by launching the loader via RDP access (i.e. no smbexec, wmiexec, etc).

## Roadmap

- ~~Add optional flag to hardcode arguments to be passed to assembly~~
- ~~Add optional flag to redirect output to an encrypted file~~
- ~~Randomize encryption key per build~~
- Refactor Python pre-build scripts (a complete mess)
- Dynamically generate & randomize `assemblyinfo.cs`
- Add option to key on AD domain
- Improve error handling where possible
